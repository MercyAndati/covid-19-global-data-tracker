# Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from Our World in Data to explore the pandemic's impact across selected countries. It includes data cleaning, visualization of cases, deaths, vaccinations, and the creation of an interactive choropleth map to display case distribution globally.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess COVID-19 data for selected countries.

- Explore trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

- Calculate and analyze death rates across countries.

- Visualize key metrics using line plots, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.

- Build an interactive choropleth map to visualize case density by country.

- Summarize key insights and anomalies discovered in the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3

- pandas

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- plotly.express
