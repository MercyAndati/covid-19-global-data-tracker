# Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from Our World in Data to explore the pandemic's impact across selected countries. It includes data cleaning, visualization of cases, deaths, vaccinations, and the creation of an interactive choropleth map to display case distribution globally.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess COVID-19 data for selected countries.

- Explore trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

- Calculate and analyze death rates across countries.

- Visualize key metrics using line plots, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.

- Build an interactive choropleth map to visualize case density by country.

- Summarize key insights and anomalies discovered in the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3

- pandas

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- plotly.express


## MARKDOWN
- The United States exhibited the highest total COVID-19 cases as of the latest data.

- Several African countries show significantly lower vaccination rates compared to the global average.

- The United States had the highest number of new cases, while Kenya had the least. 

- The death rate, calculated as total deaths divided by total cases, ranges from about 1.1% to 2.5%, reflecting differences in healthcare, demographics, and reporting.

- An anomaly was observed in India, where total vaccination numbers dropped sharply, likely due to reporting delays.

- Vaccinated states showed lower case counts compared to unvaccinated states, suggesting vaccine effectiveness in reducing infections.
